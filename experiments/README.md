# 🧪 MNIST Experiments

Try these experiments to understand neural networks better!

## 📁 Experiment Files

- `experiment_1_architecture.py` - Try different hidden layer sizes
- `experiment_2_learning_rates.py` - Compare learning rates
- `experiment_3_full_dataset.py` - Use all 60,000 training samples
- `experiment_4_visualization.py` - Advanced plotting and analysis

## 🎯 Suggested Experiments

### 1. Architecture Exploration
```python
# Try these hidden layer sizes:
hidden_sizes = [32, 64, 128, 256, 512]
# Plot accuracy vs network size
```

### 2. Learning Rate Study
```python
# Compare learning rates:
learning_rates = [0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0]
# Find the sweet spot!
```

Happy experimenting! 🚀
